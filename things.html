					I am an active member of the school's <a href = "https://www.spartabots.org"> robotics club. </a> Our club focuses on competing in the
					FIRST Robotics Competition as the Skyline Spartabots. I have the leadership role of build lead for the 2018 build and competition season, 
					in preparation of FIRST Power Up. Written below are lyrics to our only rap song, the "Gracious Professionalism Rhythm".<br>
						<br>
						Yo, robotics club is just so cool<br>
						We build robots everyday after school<br>
						In a janitorial closet that's full of tools<br>
						And we collect buttons like they're shiny jewels<br>
						Competitions at FIRST are the highlight of my year<br>
						I got my whole life devoted to be in the top tier<br>
						You may think that I'm a noob but let's make this stuff clear<br>
						I'm in robotics club, and the HYPE STARTS HERE<br>

				<p style="color: 33a27f; background-color: white">
					<a href = "https://www.athletic.net/CrossCountry/Athlete.aspx?AID=10415977#/L0"> I run for the Skyline Cross Country JV team. </a>
					I have been running cross country since the summer before my freshman year up until now. 
					My personal record in the 5K race is 19:44.70.

			<h2 style="color: 43484c; background-color: white">Overwatch</h2>
				<p style="background-color:white"><img src="overwatch logo.png"></img></p>
				<p style="color: f99e1a; background-color: white">
					<a href = "https://playoverwatch.com"> Overwatch </a> is a game developed by Blizzard Entertainment. It is a multiplayer first-person shooter where players assume the roles of "heroes", 
					each with a unique backstory and ability set which distinguishes him or her in the battle arena. Once upon a time I was asked to be a substitute 
					Overwatch player for the Skyline eSports team, in which we tied (though I am not an official team member). The online Overwatch community is very salty, 
					but produces the freshest of video game memes.

			<h2 style="color: 4d2a0a; background-color:fcf0e4">Food</h2>
					<p style="color: 4d2a0a; background-color:fcf0e4">
					I love food. My parents, having grown up in China, cook homestyle Chinese food almost every day (and it's
					nothing like Americanized Chinese food; it's a lot better). My favorite restaurant is Bai Tong in Issaquah Highlands, which serves Thai cuisine. 
					Occasionally I enjoy making simple baked goods, such as biscuits, cookies, muffins, and French meringues (though I'm not good at the latter). <br>

			<h2 style="color: white; background-color: 806382">Bubble Tea</h2>
					<p style="color: white; background-color:806382">
					I have developed a recent obsession with bubble tea, a.k.a. boba. One day I was out
					with my robotics friends and they drove me to ShareTea in Redmond. I fell in love with bubble tea then and there. I have recently learned how to roll tapioca balls to make 
					the iconic boba pearls, and I have made	chocolate, matcha, and smoothie variations of the beverage at home.<br>
